You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

So far in this course I have learned about the tree-like structure of HTML and how to implement this structure to create the skeleton of a webpage. More generally, I have sharpened three skills essential to web development: attention to detail, diligence, and Google-fu (or how to find useful answers on Google).

The difficulty in web development is not to be found in the ideas or underlying structures but in the implementation of those structures within a defined scope. So I would say that I found understanding the concept of HTML and its structure to be easier than utilizing that knowledge to pass a series of tests.

Problem solving strategies that I have gained thus far in this course include: rereading the question at hand to ensure that I am within the scope of the problem and searching through Google to find resources that answer my questions without falling into rabbit holes that divert me from the present task.
